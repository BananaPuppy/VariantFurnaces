Fully configure what you can compost!<br>
Comes pre-configured with what I think should be compostable.

### Config
***config change requires restart***<br>
Add / Replace<br>
- namespace:path chance%<br>
- ex: "minecraft:rotten_flesh 10%"

Remove<br>
- -namespace:path<br>

### Compatibility
This mod should be compatible with other mods.<br>
If you find an issue, please [report](https://github.com/BananaPuppy/MoreComposting/issues/new/choose) it.


### TODO
Don't require restart on config change?
